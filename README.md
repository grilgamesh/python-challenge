# python-challenge
solution to week 3 homework


This file reads in the finacial spreadsheet, then loops through the monthly change data, storing it in a list. it then uses standard python functions on that list to output the required information.

For the election data, the file uses a dictionary. for every vote, it checks if it is a name it has already met; if it has not, it files that name as a key with an index of 1, otherwise it increments the index. it then outputs percentages and absolute values, and finds the winner by using a comparison statement.

see the annotations in the code for more information.
